    <ul>
        <li><p>I am not defining here which data format language this should
        be presented in.  It could use standard EDI formatting, XML, YAML,
        or any other common markup language.   But it has to be a TEXT
        format, not binary.</p></li>
        <li><p>Some fields should be optional (as in excluding data in them
        does not cause the file to be rejected.  Certain others would be
        required</p></li>
        <li><p>Creating this in a standard markup language will make it
        easier to create the file in any code editor.  Additionally there
        could be standalone file creation applications,  and extensions to
        word processors like LibreOffice, Calligra Suite, OnlyOffice, and
        others.   There would likely be online services to create the file
        online and download when done.</p></li>
        <li><p>The specification must be fully open and documented.  Any
        extensions need to be added to the main specification.   If
        additional data is needed by a particular site, the user would be
        prompted to add that data after successfully uploading their resume
        file.</p></li>
        <li><p>This will, by itâ€™s very nature, not be a substitute for a
        human-readable resume.</p></li>
        <li><p>These are just proposed fields.  The actual names of them
        would be codified in the specification.</p></li>
    </ul>
